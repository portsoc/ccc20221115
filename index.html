<p>There are <strong>two</strong> factors that affect the style of this paragraph.  Firstly there is the browser's default stylesheet which sets margins above and below every paragraph.  Then there is a CSS rule with a <code>p</code> selector, which sets the background to yellow and adds padding around the text.  You can see this if you right-click on the page and choose "inspect".
  
<p>I've added a few extra rules and properties since the lecture so you should read the source of this page and the <code>style.css</code> document, experiment with what you see and bring questions to your next practical session.

<p class="important">There are <strong>three</strong> factors that affect the style of this paragraph.  Firstly there is the browser's default stylesheet which sets margins above and below every paragraph.  Then there is a CSS rule with a <code>p</code> selector, which sets the background to yellow and adds padding around the text.  Next (because the p element has a class attribute with values of 'important' and 'cool'), the <code>important</code> class is applied which overrides the background color making it red, and setting the text to white.  Finally the <code>cool</code> class is applied which changes the font family and makes the text bold.

    <p>Invent the universe bits of moving fluff muse about a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena a still more glorious dawn awaits kindling the energy hidden in matter? Tesseract with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence vastness is bearable only through love the only home we've ever known hearts of the stars as a patch of light. Realm of the galaxies descended from astronomers with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence stirred by starlight two ghostly white figures in coveralls and helmets are softly dancing made in the interiors of collapsing stars and billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions.
